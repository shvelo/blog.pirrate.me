I've recently built an useless app called [DogeHub](http://doge.pirrate.me) where you control a Shibe with your pointer and message other users. The app is written in Node.JS and using WebSockets, originally forked from [PointerHub](https://github.com/Stichoza/pointerhub). I've started with replacing the pointer with Doge but ended up rewriting almost everything. Currently Dogehub is hosted on [OpenShift Online](https://www.openshift.com/products/online) for free.
