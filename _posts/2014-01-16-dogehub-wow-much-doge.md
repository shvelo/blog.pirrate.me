I've recently built an useless app called [DogeHub](http://doge.pirrate.me),
 where you control a Shibe with your pointer and message other users.
 The app is written in Node.JS and using WebSockets,
 originally forked from [PointerHub](https://github.com/Stichoza/pointerhub),
 which is made by my friend [Stichoza](https://github.com/Stichoza).
 I've started with replacing the pointer with Doge but ended up rewriting almost everything.
 Currently Dogehub is hosted on [NodeJitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/) for free.
