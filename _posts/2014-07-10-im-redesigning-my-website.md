title: "I'm redesigning my website"
---

I feel like it's been long since I've updated my site, [Pirrate.me](http://pirrate.me), 
so I've decided to try and finally redesign it. I don't have much free time but well, 
I need to have a proper website.
I'm not gonna use anything [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), because I'm 
already bored with it. I need something new and interesting.

You can check the process out in the GitHub repository 
[<i class="icon-github"></i> shvelo/pirrate.me](https://github.com/shvelo/pirrate.me).

### Yarr!
